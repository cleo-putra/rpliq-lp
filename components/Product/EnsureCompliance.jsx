          <p>
            At the core of RPL iQâ€™s functionality is a commitment to regulatory
            compliance. The platform is meticulously designed to align with the
            standards set by the Australian Skills Quality Authority (ASQA) and
            other regulatory bodies. As any other student management system RPL
            iQ was designed and crafted with a compliance-first mindset,
            providing RTOs with the tools they need to meet and exceed
            regulatory expectations.
